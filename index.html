    <p>My favourite type of music is <u>Rock</u>. I especially like the band <em>Arctic Monkeys</em>. I like the genre because Rock music is unique, seen in how <strong>upbeat and energetic</strong> it is. The voices of the people who sing rock music are also very vocally gifted, since they must have a <strong>powerful</strong> voice.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Times; font-size: 15px; color: #2f0272; text-align: center;">The lead singer in Arctic Monkeys is <em>Alex Turner</em>. He is 38 years old and was born on <u>January 6, 1986</u>. He is known for his lyrics, which consist of clever wordplay, and oftentimes deep meaning.</p>
